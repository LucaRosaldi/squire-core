# Squire CSS (Core)

Squire is a scalable Object Oriented CSS framework inspired by ITCSS and SMACSS, with a simplified BEM syntax. It aims to be a very unopinionated and barebones CSS-only boilerplate for every kind of web project.

This is just the core SCSS library. To start a web project, please clone one of these repositories:

- Squire Framework – The very start. Just HTML, SCSS and Javascript
- Squire App – Simple PHP application with basic routing and i18n. Perfect for multipage websites.
- Squire WP – Starter WordPress theme with Gutenberg blocks based on Squire Framework *(coming soon)*
